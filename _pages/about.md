# About me
Nice to meet you! I am Jiajun ZHU (Êú±ÂÆ∂È™è), an undergraduate student at Chu Kochen Honors College of Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology (GPA: 3.87/4.00). During my undergraduate studies, I have been supervised by [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/) and [Dr. Di Weng](https://dwe.ng/en/about/) in [ZJU IDG Lab](https://zjuidg.org/) since July 2023. And I have collaborated with [Dr. Xinhuan Shu](https://shuxinhuan.github.io/). From July 2025, I'll undertake a multi-month visiting internship at [HKUST VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://www.huamin.org/).

My previous main research direction was HCI, Visualization Analysis and Interaction System Design in Data Science. **I'm exploring PhD opportunities after obtaining my bachlor‚Äôs degree and broadly interested in HCI and Visualization. Open to chat!**
<!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
